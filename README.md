# Fan-Letter-Subscription

This is the source code for a web app that allows users to signup to a newsletter/fanletter subscription. The data will be registered to my mailchimp account where I can send all subscribers fan letters.

I've inclued the JSON file so that you can see what modules I've used while developing this web app. The API key and list_id have been replaced by placeholders for security reasons.

You can visit and sign-up for my Fan-letter subscription here: https://obscure-river-15202.herokuapp.com
